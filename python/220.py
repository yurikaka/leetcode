# 220. Contains Duplicate III
#
# Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
#
# Solution:
# The idea is like the bucket sort algorithm. Suppose we have consecutive buckets covering the range of nums with each bucket a width of (t+1). If there are two item with difference <= t, one of the two will happen:
#
# (1) the two in the same bucket
# (2) the two in neighbor buckets
